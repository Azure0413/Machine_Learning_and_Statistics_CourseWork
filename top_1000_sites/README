Google's list of the top 1000 sites on the web, based on data gathered by DoubleClick.

Result data can be found top_1000_sites.tsv

To run, just redirect output of top_1000_sites.py to a file. In my case, I ran 

python -i top_1000_sites.py > top_1000_sites.tsv

to produce top_1000_sites.tsv
